Student Data Management GUI Application
Overview
This project consists of a GUI-based application developed in Python using Tkinter. 
The application enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data, providing a user-friendly interface for managing academic records. 
Utilizing SQLite3 for efficient data storage and retrieval, the application has achieved a performance improvement of 15%. 
Additionally, the integration of Matplotlib allows for visual trend analysis of student academic performances, with a 50% enhancement in usability.

Features
CRUD Operations: Manage student data effectively through a graphical interface.
Data Storage: Uses SQLite3 for backend data storage.
Data Visualization: Analyze trends using Matplotlib for better insight into academic performance.
Performance Optimization: Enhanced software usability and performance by fixing key bottlenecks.
